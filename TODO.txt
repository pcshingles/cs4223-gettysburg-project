Version 2:
1. Ensure all previous valid master tests provided pass

5. ensure that we cant end the battle step without resolving potential battles
6. ensure that we cant resolve a battle if the units of that battle have already fought that turn

4. Test to make sure that we can at least move a unit s.t. an enemy gets placed into their ZoC
5. Re-test all of the old battle tests to make sure that battles still work when using the setBattleResults method
